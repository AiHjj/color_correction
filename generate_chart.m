%
% The function generate_chart returns two variables:
% chart - the generated color chart
% patch_info - a nrgb X 4 matrix that specifies where each individual color patch is
% located within the color chart. For each color patch, this information is
% specified as the first row position, the first column position, the row size,
% and the column size, in that order.
%
% The random RGB color chart is generated according to user-specified inputs:
% nrows - total number of pixels, or rows, in the vertical direction (e.g, 1704)
% ncols - total number of pixels, or cols, in the horizontal direction (e.g., 2272)
% nrgb - number of red, green, and blue combinations, or color patches (e.g., 4)
% low_red - the lowest red value to include (e.g., 0)
% high_red - the highest red value to include (e.g., 255)
% low_green - the lowest green value to include (e.g., 0)
% high_green - the highest green value to include (e.g., 255)
% low_blue - the lowest blue value to include (e.g., 0)
% high_blue - the highest blue value to include (e.g., 255)
% spacing - number of black border pixels between different color patches (e.g., 8)
% safety - the safety margin (e.g., 16) to add to the patch_info to eliminate transitions
% between the color patches in the least squares estimate routine. Safety
% is added to the patch start locations and 2*safety is subtracted from the
% patch sizes to provide a safety border all the way around the patch.
chart = zeros(nrows, ncols, 3); % Initial chart will contain all black

% The code will compute nrgb color samples randomly spaced from their respective
% low to high values. These colors are then mapped to a two dimensional color chart.
